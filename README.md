This is a phase 1 JavaScript project for Flatiron School. In this project I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a basic web application. This application is used to find beverages based on a users input into the search field. The search field looks up the input and returns results even based on a partial find. The results are returned in a container for the user to look at. The results will contain an image of the drink, the ingredients, and the measurements of ingredients. The user can also "like" the drink if they choose.
